# CSCI 115 - Term Project (Part 1)

This README file contains instructions about how to run and compile the code(s) for 
the Part 1 section of the CSCI 115 Term Project for the Fall 2021 semester.

## Part 1 - Sorting Algorithms
Part 1 of this project contains one main file named: main.cpp.
This .cpp file calls all the respective header files (.h files) that contain the function prototypes.
The functions itself for each algorithm can be found in their respective .cpp files.
This was done so that it would be easier for any member of the group to update/change
a specific part of the program rather than changing a bigger portion of the program overall.
It helps simplify and make the code more readable and more editable/accessible.

2. Press the run button located on the top left of the website to start compiling and running the program.
3. After inputting the required information to the program, you would expect to see the output via the terminal itself.
